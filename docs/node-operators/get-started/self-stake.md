import NetworkParameter from '@site/src/components/NetworkParameter';

You must stake at least <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="reward.staking.delegation.minimumValidatorStake" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/> that you own.

When staking, you must use the same key you used to set up the node.

Your stake and rewards can be boosted if other token holders delegate to you once the network is live.
