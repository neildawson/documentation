# Node operators

This section offers guidance on how to launch, maintain, and upgrade a node, and how to earn promotion to standby or consensus status for greater rewards.

## Become a validator

### The validator lifecycle

All validators begin as candidates, and can be promoted for high performance. Promotion comes with rewards and higher performance expectations. Learn about [the requirements of the three validator types](node-operators/requirements).

### How performance is assessed

Validators are ranked by their validator score, and their position in the ranking determines which type of validator they are. The score is influenced by factors like delegated stake amount and performance. Learn more about [how validators are assessed](/node-operators/ranking).

### Set up a new node
When you're acquainted with the validator lifecycle, requirements, and performance criteria, follow the [tutorial to set up and run a validating node](node-operators/get-started).

## Maintain an existing node

The [how-to guides](node-operators/how-to) detail common node maintenance activities.
