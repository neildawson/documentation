# Node operators

Get guidance on how to maintain and upgrade a node. 

## Becoming a validator

1. Start a Vega validating node, including the associated infrastructure (see below)
2. Submit a transaction using their keys, announcing they want to validate, and receive a response that the network has verified key ownership (see below)
3. Self-stake to their validator Vega key at least ðŸ‘€3000 tokens
4. Wait for others to nominate them. It would be worth announcing to the community that you have started a node and are looking for stake)
