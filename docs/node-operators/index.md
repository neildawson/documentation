# Node operators

This section offers guidance on how to launch, maintain, and upgrade a node, and how to earn promotion to standby or consensus status for greater rewards.

## Become a validator

1. Start a Vega validating node, including the associated infrastructure (see below)
2. Submit a transaction using their keys, announcing they want to validate, and receive a response that the network has verified key ownership (see below)
3. Self-stake to their validator Vega key at least ðŸ‘€3000 tokens
4. Wait for others to nominate them. It would be worth announcing to the community that you have started a node and are looking for stake)

## Set up a new node
Follow the [tutorial to set up and run a validating node](get-started).

## Maintain an existing node

Our [how-to guides](how-to) detail common node maintenance activities.
