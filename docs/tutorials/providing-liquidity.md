title: Providing liquidity using APIs
hide_title: false

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a liquidity provision order to provide liquidity on a live market created with Vega. You'll have to actively manage your liquidity commitment, so you'll also learn how to amend your order, as well as cancel it. 

If you proposed a market that was enacted and want to change your liquidity provision shape, skip down to [amend your liquidity commitment]. 

Notes to cover: 
-Description and information for each piece of code, what it does and general, high-level guidelines of how this kind of thing works.
-Question: is anything about the sample scripts testnet-specific that needs to be highlighted/changed?
-LP on Vega is manual, not automatic. Once you choose the shape, you'll need to keep track of it and actively manage your LP. 
-You'll need enough collateral to cover the orders and the margin. If not... penalties and closeouts.
-Add section that links to Vega Tool to track liquidity commitment, and an explanation of how to go about using it.
