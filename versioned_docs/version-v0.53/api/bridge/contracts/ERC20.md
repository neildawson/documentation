# ERC20.sol

View Source: [contracts/tests/ERC20.sol](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/Staking_Bridge/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol)

**ERC20**

Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 For a generic mechanism see {ERC20Mintable}.
 TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 to implement supply mechanisms].
 We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| spender | address |  | 
| value | uint256 |  | 

### transferFrom

See {IERC20-transferFrom}.
 Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
 required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20};
 Requirements:
 - `sender` and `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
 - `sender` must have a balance of at least `value`.
 - the caller must have allowance for `sender`'s tokens of at least
 `amount`.

```js
function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| sender | address |  | 
| recipient | address |  | 
| amount | uint256 |  | 

### increaseAllowance

Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.
 This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
 problems described in {IERC20-approve}.
 Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.
 Requirements:
 - `spender` cannot be the zero address.

```js
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| spender | address |  | 
| addedValue | uint256 |  | 

### decreaseAllowance

Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.
 This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
 problems described in {IERC20-approve}.
 Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.
 Requirements:
 - `spender` cannot be the zero address.
 - `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least
 `subtractedValue`.

```js
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

### _transfer
